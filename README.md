# Simfy-Africa-Assessment

## About Project

I was able to complete this assessment in the following thought process. firstly i used CRA to set up the boilerplate.
Next i designed a simple home page with placeholder content. 
All my styling was done using standard CSS to show that i have a  good understanding  of how it works.
I then set-up the routes and designed the grid that the videos should use.
Using a re-usable function i implemented a DRY approach to fetch the data and store the the results in the Context API.
After this i was able to pass the context down the component tree to where i needed it.
I then proceed to map and display all videos in a list and added styling.
Now i began to setup a dynamic route based on  the id of the video.
I then started to work on the video details part of the project and styling and displaying data from the context.

## What i used.

I used Create-React-App, CSS, Context API and the API.
